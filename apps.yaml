    Notality is a very simple note taking app. I mostly built it to learn how Flutter works, but it's functional and you can use it.

    <b>Features</b>

    - Create, edit, delete and reorder notes
    - Automatic dark/light mode depending on the system-wide setting
    - Import/Export your notes to save them externally
    - Localization for English and German

    Make a fortune quietly. NaïveProxy uses Chromium's network stack to camouflage traffic with strong censorship resistence and low detectablility. Reusing Chrome's stack also ensures best practices in performance and security.

    <b>Features</b>

    - Website fingerprinting / traffic classification: mitigated by traffic multiplexing in HTTP/2.
    - TLS parameter fingerprinting: defeated by reusing Chrome's network stack.
    - Active probing: defeated by application fronting, i.e. hiding proxy servers behind a commonly used frontend server with application-layer routing.
    - Length-based traffic analysis: mitigated by length padding.
